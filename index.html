    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>18 year old engineering student at KIIT pursuing a B.Tech. in CSE. Currently in my first semester, learning exciting things everyday, making valued friends and constantly figuring out ways to make the walk from the campus to my room as fast and short as humanly possible. When I'm not particularly busy with classes, studies or coding, you'll finding me hanging out with friends, chatting about almost every topic. Most of my projects are things that sounded fun in my head and I somehow decided to invest time, energy and mental real estate in them. Some get to see the light of the day (light of my room lights that is, engineering students do not see the sun), most lay dormant in some obscure GitHub repository that I couldn't be bothered to maintain.</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Self-made Linux distribution
        <p>Got challenged to develop a linux distro all by myself, accepted it and crushed it. Named it BinodOS becauase back in the days, that meme was really funny. Check out the demo  <a href="https://youtu.be/QOLStTjyV8E?si=IWqnlP6Vevlfvs7M">video</a>. Also, I edited and synced the video myself.</p>
        
        Features and Highlights:
        <ul>
          <li>Very light on the system. Uses around 135 MB of ram space while idle (with background processes and daemons running). Uses less than 2 GB even with a video editor open.</li>
          <li>Global dark mode. Because it looks good to me.</li>
          <li>Global Ad Blocking with personalized port blocking. Hate it when companies, for some reason, invest more in audience research and monitoring with cookies and ads than they invest in their damn product development. Block every single port you don't need and sleep in peace knowing practically no one other than you can let those viruses and malewares in.</li>
          <li>Global search with <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">FZF</a> enabled to help you grab things quickly. When you open them, Vim's intelligent file-type AI figures out the type and opens them with a software with the least load at that time. And for every file you decide to edit, the integrated code editor will download, install, setup and optimize the toolchain and environment for that type to help you work.</li>
          <li>Due to the light resource usage, your kernel can readily produce spaace and processing power for your tasks, unlike with Windows.</li>
          <li>Comes with a minimalistic <a href="https://i3wm.org/">I3-wm</a>desktop environment for keyboard driven workflow. It also helps with carpal tunnel that most developers are statistically proven to develop due to using a mouse.</li>
          <li>Remains free. My 16 year old self that made it didn't realize the importance of money to give it away. And I'm too noble to put a pay wall. So yes, it is still free. Sadly I did not generate revenue to keep the servers going, so you'll have to ask me personally (nicely) for a copy of the OS.

        Entire song using only saw waves
        <p>To show off my sound engineering skills, I made an EDM track using only rudimentary saw waves. Everything from the drums to the basses were made solely from saw waves. Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/84qWtGKs5OY?si=2iF2V2zbNOy51ZVg">video</a>.</p>

        Noisia-Mantra neuro remake
        <p>Dubstep, DNB and Neuro have always been very interesting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rMc6eal7RkI?si=EvEbPG62yFqeCkOd">This video</a> is my remake of the track <a href="https://youtu.be/50oHjGnnS_0?si=fMpRQyGzQhm_HhlH">Mantra</a> produced by bass music giants Noisia.</p>

      <li>DepressionInducingTerminal

        <p>Chilled out Kitty theme, prompt model and configuration for computer science nerds working in Linux terminals. Quite literally what the project name says. After working on code for long hours, last thing I want is something very colorful, with soul and vibrant. Give me my muted colors on a dark background and I'll remain calm. <a href="https://github.com/AUMGT/DepressionInducingTerminal">Download here.</a></p>
